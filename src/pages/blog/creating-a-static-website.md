## The Motivation

I learned about [Astro](https://astro.build) via the CEO of Ping Labs and all-around nice guy, [Theo.gg](https://youtube.com/@t3dotgg), a youtuber. I looked into Astro and was taken aback by both its functionality and the ecosystem of items it brought with it.

I thought the Astro website was really quick when I initially saw it and it quoted **Build faster websites**, which was enough for me to take a deep dive into it. I then started looking for astro projectsÂ to engage in and made the decision to create a static blogging website at that same moment.

## Features

Astro has lots of features:

- Integrations(React, Tailwindcss, Svlete to name a few.)
- Readme support(The one you are reading now!)
- Server Side Rendering(SSR first!)

and many more!!

## Dev Experience

The documentation is good, with sufficient examples. Astro also has a CLI utility for project creation if you don't want to configure it yourself.

The **integrations** that astro delivers are what make it so powerful. Astro includes an `add` command that may be used to integrate various integrations into your project. The main syntax of astro is straightforward, but you may also use other framework assistance to construct your components, such as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

To make this website I used Astro, Tailwindcss, @astro/images and readme. The experience was smooth and straightforward from starting server to serving everything on vercel edge.

## Conclusion

I really liked what problems astro solves and how it tackels them. If you still haven't looked into astro yet for your next potential project you should, because if I ever wanted to work with static sites again, astro will be my go to *(for now)*.
